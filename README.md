# rhel_patching
This module contains a set of tasks and custom facts to allow the automation of and reporting on operating system patching, currently restricted to Redhat derivitives.

#### Table of Contents

## Description

Puppet tasks and bolt have opened up methods to integrate operating system level patching into the pupept workflow.  Providing automation of patch execution through tasks and the robust reporting of state through custom facts and PuppetDB.

If you're looking for a simple way to report on your OS patch levels, this module will show all updates which are outstanding, including which are related to security updates.  Do you want to enable self-service patching?  This module will use Puppet's RBAC and orchestration facilities to give you that power.

## Setup

### What rhel_patching affects **OPTIONAL**

If it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For example, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects their MySQL instances.

If there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to mention:

* Files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact, or execute.
* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.
* Warnings or other important notices.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled, another module, etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section here.

### Beginning with rhel_patching

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most basic use of the module.

## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage examples and code samples for doing things with your module.

## Reference

Users need a complete list of your module's classes, types, defined types providers, facts, and functions, along with the parameters for each. You can provide this list either via Puppet Strings code comments or as a complete list in the README Reference section.

* If you are using Puppet Strings code comments, this Reference section should include Strings information so that your users know how to access your documentation.

* If you are not using Puppet Strings, include a list of all of your classes, defined types, and so on, along with their parameters. Each element in this listing should include:

  * The data type, if applicable.
  * A description of what the element does.
  * Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
  * Default value, if any.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
